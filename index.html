                <p>Looking ahead, I am eager to contribute my skills and knowledge to meaningful projects that have a positive impact on society</p>

                <p>I am open to new opportunities, collaborations, and connecting with fellow professionals in the engineering community.</p>

                <p>Thank you for taking the time to learn about me and my journey as an engineering student. I am excited about the future
                possibilities that engineering holds and how I can contribute to shaping a better world through innovation and

                        <h2>Machine Language<br /> Programming </h2>
                        <div class="h-50"></div>
                        <p>Machine language, also known as machine code or low-level language, is a type of programming language that directly
                        represents instructions executed by a computer's central processing unit (CPU). It is the lowest level of programming
                        languages and is specific to the architecture of the computer's hardware. Machine language is considered the "native
                        language" of a computer and is the only language that the CPU can directly understand and execute.
                        <br><br>
                        Machine language instructions are written in binary code, which consists of sequences of 0s and 1s. Each instruction
                        corresponds to a specific operation that the CPU can perform, such as arithmetic operations (e.g., addition,
                        subtraction), data movement, logical operations, and control flow (e.g., branching and looping).

                        While machine language is the most fundamental level of programming for a computer, it is challenging for humans to work
                        with directly. It is tedious and error-prone to write programs using only 0s and 1s. To make programming more manageable
                        and human-readable, higher-level programming languages (e.g., C, Python, Java) have been developed. These languages are
                        then translated or compiled into machine language by software called compilers or interpreters, respectively.
                        <br><br>
                        The translation process from a high-level language to machine language involves multiple intermediate steps, including
                        assembly language, which uses mnemonic codes (e.g., ADD, SUB, JMP) to represent machine instructions. Assembly language
                        is easier for humans to work with compared to raw binary machine code, but it still requires an assembler to convert it
                        into machine code for the computer to execute.</p>

                        Cores: A CPU can have multiple cores, each capable of processing tasks independently. Dual-core, quad-core, hexa-core,
                        octa-core, and even higher core-count CPUs are common today. More cores generally lead to better multitasking and
                        improved performance for multi-threaded applications.
                        <br><br>
                        Clock Speed: The clock speed, measured in GHz (gigahertz), indicates how many cycles the CPU can execute per second. A
                        higher clock speed typically means faster processing, but other factors like architecture and number of cores also
                        affect overall performance.
                        <br><br>
                        Threads: Modern CPUs often support multi-threading, which allows each core to handle two threads simultaneously,
                        effectively increasing the number of concurrent tasks the CPU can handle.
                        <br><br>
                        Cache Memory: CPUs have built-in cache memory that stores frequently accessed data and instructions, providing quicker
                        access than main memory (RAM). There are different levels of cache, with L1 being the fastest but smallest and L3 being
                        larger but slightly slower.
                        <br><br>
                        Architecture: CPUs are built based on specific architectures (e.g., x86, x86-64, ARM), which dictate their instruction
                        set and capabilities. Different architectures are used in various devices, such as desktop computers, laptops,
                        smartphones, and servers.
                        <br><br>
                        Heat Dissipation: CPUs generate heat during operation due to their high-speed computations. To prevent overheating, they
                        are equipped with heatsinks and fans, especially in desktop computers.
                        <br><br>
                        Overclocking: Some CPUs can be overclocked, which involves increasing their clock speeds beyond the manufacturer's
                        specifications to gain extra performance. However, this can also lead to higher power consumption and increased heat
                        output.
                        <br><br>
                        CPU Brands: Some well-known CPU manufacturers are Intel and AMD, which produce CPUs for various devices, including
                        personal computers and servers.
                        <br><br>
                        Integrated Graphics: Many modern CPUs include integrated graphics processing units (GPUs) on the same chip, allowing
                        computers to display graphics without the need for a separate dedicated graphics card</p>
